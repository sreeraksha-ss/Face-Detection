# Face-Detection
This Repository Consists of my Face Detection projects
I have used Voila-Jones one of the prominent face detection algoritms

* Face_Detection_Viola_Jones(single_and_multi_faces) file consists of code using classes and objects to detect a single face on a single image or multi faces on a single image
* If youre intrested only in the reults they are in the files DetectionSumedh.jpg and MultifaceDetection are the results.

The steps include:
* Reading the image
* Adding rectangle on faces
* Putting text on detected face and also saving using cv2
